Hi chat, we are doing the magic that all kid wants to happen.

I want to make a present for my nephew's birthday and we want to make this happen without you losing the 200 000 tokens context, and here we have some initial brainstorm.
Create your initial claude.md from this prompt, in the current folder that will be a project folder for my nephew. Folder:"MonkaCraft", here are the .MD files that we have created as your tasks that you need to complete: c:\Users\Daradudai\MonkaCraft\MonkaCraft_Claude_Code_Prompt.md & c:\Users\Daradudai\MonkaCraft\MonkaCraft_CLAUDE_MD_Orchestration.md
